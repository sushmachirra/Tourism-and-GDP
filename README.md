This project aims to visually represent the Tourism and GDP dataset and explore the relationships between different attributes. 
To achieve this, three different visualization platforms have been utilized, namely Tableau, Vizhub, and Python. 
The project employs various tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Seaborn, etc. to facilitate data visualization and analysis.
To represent the data effectively, a range of visualization techniques have been employed.
For instance, pie charts have been used to showcase the part-to-whole relationship, bar charts to demonstrate trends over time, line charts to compare attributes over time, scatter plots to display correlations, distributions, and clusters in the data, and map charts to exhibit geographical regions.
To make the project accessible to a broader audience, a website has been designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, where the visualizations have been presented in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
The website has been deployed on Amazon Web Services, ensuring ease of access to users.
